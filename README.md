SignFlow is an interactive web application designed to help users learn the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet in a fun and engaging way. The app provides two main modes:

ðŸ§  Learn Mode â€“ Offers a visual guide to each letter of the ASL alphabet with helpful tips.

ðŸŽ¯ Quiz Mode â€“ Challenges users to recognize and select the correct ASL letter from multiple choices, helping reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned.

This project was created with accessibility and education in mind, aiming to make sign language more approachable for beginners through a clean interface and responsive experience.
